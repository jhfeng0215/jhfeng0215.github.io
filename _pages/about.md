I am PHD students from School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)(中国科学技术大学), Hefei, Anhui. Current I am a second year Phd student in the Development of Management Science and Engineering, USTC(管理学院管理科学与工程专业), advised by [Hefu Liu(刘和福)](http://bs.ustc.edu.cn/Chinese/Profile-74.html). I also collaborate with [Meng Chen(陈猛)](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/chinese/profile-2125.html),[Juan Qin (秦娟)](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/chinese/profile-1881.html) from USTC closely.

Besides, I am a research interner in DIDI <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> from 2023.11 to Now. I was a research interner in Xiaoan Tech <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">  from 2023.6 to 2023.9. During the interner period, I deveploed alogrithms had been deploved in these companies. 



My reserch interest includes Customer Behavior Analysis (Informtion System Direction), Traffic prediction & Sceduling (Intelligent Transportation Direction) and Operation Management (Classical Management)
. To be honest, I am a fresh Geek, My reserach method including Traditional deep learning method, Reinforcemt Learning methods, including graph neural network (GNN), hyper-GNN, Komogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN).
I also focus on Interpretability deep learning mehtods. Besides, I am also learning emperical methods and field experiment skills. I have publish some papers at the top information System conferences such as ICIS, PACIS and some journals. And some works is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD, CCF-B), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE ITS, CCF-B), IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management (IEEE TEM) and Expert Systems with Applocations (ESWA, CCF-B).
