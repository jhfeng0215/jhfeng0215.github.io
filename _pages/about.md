# 👨 About Me

I am a PhD student at the School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) (中国科学技术大学), Hefei, Anhui. Currently, I am in my second year of the PhD program in Management Science and Engineering (管理学院管理科学与工程专业) at USTC, advised by [Hefu Liu (刘和福)](http://bs.ustc.edu.cn/Chinese/Profile-74.html). 

In addition, I am currently a research intern at DiDi <img src='./images/didi-log-1.png' style="width: 4em;"> since November 2023. Previously, I was a research intern at Xiaoan Tech <img src='./images/xian,jpg' style="width: 4em;"> from June 2023 to September 2023. During these internships, I developed algorithms that have been successfully deployed in these companies.
 



My research interests include Customer Behavior Analysis (Information Systems direction), Traffic Prediction & Scheduling (Intelligent Transportation direction), and Operation Management (Classical Management). I am particularly interested in research methods such as traditional deep learning techniques, reinforcement learning approaches (including Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Hyper-GNN, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)), as well as interpretable deep learning methods. Additionally, I am exploring empirical methods and field experiment skills.

I have published papers at top Information Systems conferences, such as ICIS and PACIS, and in renowned journals. My work has been accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD, CCF-B), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE ITS, CCF-B), IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management (IEEE TEM), and Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA, CCF-B).
